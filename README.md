__Project working__ :
User is first prompted to the RESTER page for him/her to sign up if he hasn't already.
After filling all the required fields, the user's data is stored in the backend SQLite database which is further used for login.
After registering, user is taken to the login page where he/she has to enter the correct username and password to login.
After logging in successfully, user is taken to a page which consists of 2 buttons, namely SI calculator and EMI calculator.
User can choose any option.
Choosing the SI calculator takes you the Simple Interest calculator. User should enter all the required fields and the result is displayed successfully.
Choosing the EMI calculator takes you the EMI calculator. User should enter all the required fields and the result is displayed successfully.

Finally, we achieve our goal of completing the Mobile Application Development Laboratory Mini Project within the given deadline.
